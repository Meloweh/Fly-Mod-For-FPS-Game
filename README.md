# Fly Mod for FPS Game Metro 2033

Metro2033 is a FPS game.

In this modification I had my first contact with Lua, with which
conversion of the camera rotations, then the direction vectors and the position vector
and added this to the position vector.

The player moves freely through the air in the direction in which the camera is pointed at.
