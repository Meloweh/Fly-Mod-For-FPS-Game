# Fly Mod for a FPS Game

The game Metro2033 was used for this instance.

In this modification I had my first contact with Lua, with which I applied a
conversion of the camera rotation into the directional vectors and the positional vector of the player
and then added the result to the positional vector.

By using the camera the player will be enabled to fly around and navigate through the air.
